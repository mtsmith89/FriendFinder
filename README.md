# Friend Finder - Node and Express Servers

### Overview

In this activity, we built a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site takes in results from a users' surveys, then compares their answers with those from other users. The app then displays the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.
